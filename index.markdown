# Hi, Welcome to my home page.

I'm Yifei Cen, a senior at <span style="font-family:sans-serif;color:#a6192e;font-size:18px">**Carnegie Mellon University**</span> studying Computer Science. 

In the spring of 2019, I was probably sitting on my chair and staring at the sophisticated python bugs I just created for my Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science (15-112) homework, the first Computer Science course I took. I could still remember how impressed I was when I could use what I wrote to solve complex Sudokus, play tetris, and handle many other complicated tasks for the first time. But, I know that 15-112 is only the surface of Computer Science, and I want to learn more about this discipline.

I continued to explore the field of Computer Science. I took Introduction to Computer Systems (15-213) where I learned how computer systems execute programs and communicate with each other. I used C programming language to work on all of my labs for 15-213. I also took Distributed Systems (15-440) where I learned techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across networks.

I'm interested in discovering more in the field of Computer Science and put what I learned in courses into real practices.
