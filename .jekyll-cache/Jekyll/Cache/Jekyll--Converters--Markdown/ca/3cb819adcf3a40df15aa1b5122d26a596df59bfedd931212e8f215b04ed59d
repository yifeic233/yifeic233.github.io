<p>I’m Yifei Cen, a senior <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Carnegie-Mellon-University</code> studying Computer Science.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2019, I was probably sitting on my chair and staring at the sophisticated python bugs I just created for my Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science (15-112) homework, the first Computer Science course I took. I could still remember how impressed I was when I could use what I wrote to solve complex Sudokus, play tetris, and handle many other complicated tasks for the first time. But, I know that 15-112 is only the surface of Computer Science, and I want to learn more about this discipline.</p>

<p>I continued to explore the field of Computer Science. I took Introduction to Computer Systems (15-213) where I learned how computer systems execute programs and communicate with each other. I used C programming language to work on all of my labs for 15-213. I also took Distributed Systems (15-440) where I learned techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across networks.</p>

<p>I’m interested in discovering more in the field of Computer Science and put what I learned in courses into real practices.</p>
